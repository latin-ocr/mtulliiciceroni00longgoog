“Anca the child hath learned perfectly the eight parta ol
speech, let him then learn the right joining together ol rabaten-
tinea nith adjectivae, the noun nith thoreth, the relative with
the antecedent. And in learning iarther hia cyntaxia, hy mine
advice, he ahall not uae tha common order in common achoolr,
l'or making oi Latinear whereby the child commonly learneth,
lint, an evil choioe of wordo¹ (and right ohoioe ol worda, raith
Caesar, ia the foundation oi eloquenoe); then anrong placing
cl norda3 and, lartly, on ill iraming oi the centenoe, with a
pervenre jndgrnent, both oswenda and rentencer. There laulta,
taking once root in youth, he never, or hardly plooked away in
age. Mereorer, there ia no one thing, that hath more, either
dulled the wite, or tehen away the will oi children from learning,
than the care they hove to eatialy their mactem in making ol
Latiner.

“ For the rolmlar ia commonly beat for the making, when the
macter were more worthy to be beat ior the monding‚ or rather
merring cf the rame, the macter many timer being ae ignorant
ea the child, nhat to ray properly and litly lo the matter.
