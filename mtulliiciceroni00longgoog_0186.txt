Quintus wrote several letters to Morcus from Britnin
(Ad Q„ Fr. iii. lond 3). In the winter of this yeor
(no. 54) Quintus was with his legion in the country of
the Nervii, nnd he browely defended his comp against cn
unexpected nttock of the cans, until Caesar come to his
help (Caesar, De Bell Gru. w. 39, bc). 'dhe extant

· correspondenoe of Cicero with his brother does not ex·

tend beyond the time when he wos quartered in the
country of the Nervii (Ad Q. Fr. iii. 8); but where the
country of the Nervii was, Morcus says thot he does not
know. nne subsequent history of Quintus is not materici
for the present purpose. He perished in the proscrip-
tion with his'brother no. 43.

There crs extant three books of the letters of Morcus
to Quintus. This, the first of the first book, is less of c
letter then cn edmonitory oddress. It hos more of the
character of (licero's oratoriecl weitings thonos his epis-
tolnry correspondence, which is easily explained when we

⁷ see the nature of the subject. Quintiis was governor of

Asia, the richeet of the Romen provinces. We moy col·
lect from the letter thot he expected to stay only s year
in Arno but Morcus, os the letter shows, hod contrived
thot his brother should bove' two yenrs, ond it hoppenod
thot he stoyed three. Hs gives some intimation of his
motives for this3 he seems, os sopho says, to hove wished
thot his brother should mehe amends byn second yepr’s
probation for certain hasty prooeedings ond wantos tem·
per in his first year. The object of the elder brother was
to mointnin ond strengthen his family in the high rn'nk
to which he hod raised it, and accordingly to melre this
