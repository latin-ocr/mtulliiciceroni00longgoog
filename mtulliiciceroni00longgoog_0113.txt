Roman notions of virtue, and connected with tho Romen
ideal of a State, he has handled the matter well, ond in
on instructive manner. He who would now treat of it
from a different point of view, and in a more eompre-
hensive manner, might still derive something from the
Roman original, as Jeremy haylor has done in his dis-
course of the Messores and Offioes of Friendship. But
itis difficolt to discuss tho nature oifriendship, soritis

on friendship ore prscticaliy useful.

It rs a kind of i‘ashion to print the Octo Major and the

a much simplet thing to handle than iriendship3 and
those who will oarefully resd the two trectises, will feel
that Cicero found it so. The whole argument of the

misunderstood, and the interpretation of several parts 1s
